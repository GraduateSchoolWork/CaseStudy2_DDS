DDS Case Study 2

DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. It is planning to leverage data science for talent management to gain a competitive edge over its competition. Their executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management and they have tasked our data science team to conduct an analysis of existing employee data.

We have to use R on a given dataset to do a data analysis to identify factors that lead to attrition.
Based on statistical analysis and evidence, we will identify the top three factors that contribute to turnover along with any other interesting trends and observations. 
We will also build models to predict attrition and salary.

### Attrition
We built a model to predict attrition that had an 87% Accuracy, 90% Sensitivity and 75% Specificity.


### Salary
We built a model to predict salary had an RMSE of 1080 and P-Value of < 2.2e-16
